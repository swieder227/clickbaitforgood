# Clickbaitforgood

This site was built in under a week to accompany a guerrilla marketing campaign.

Clickbait For Good is a non-profit that promotes charities by repurposing clickbait on social media.

## Simplicity & Progressive Enhancements
The site itself is fairly simply. However, due to the global reach and potential for lower-end device visitors, it was important to progressively enhance more expensive features.

- Site and carousel components usable without javascript
- Forms submit via traditional php
- Enhanced with javascript and ajax submit
